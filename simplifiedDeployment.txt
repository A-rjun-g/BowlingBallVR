prerequisites:
npm install gh-pages --save-dev


before : 
npm run build --> (vite build)
creates a 'dist' directory with index.html and assets(JS & CSS files)
creates locally (base: /) and it is needed for us to add ./
other larger assets like images, audios, glbs needed to be manually added through github.
Needs new repository to hold deployment and development seperately


new changes:
npm run deploy
- predeploy: vite build -> copies additional assets (images, audios, glbs)
- deploy: (predeploy) -> runs gh-pages on 'build' directory

creates a 'build' directory with all necessities for deployment
publishes to new branch 'gh-pages' under the same (project personal) repo
deploys automatically every time the command gets executed


vite.config.js : changes dist to build, adds ./ in index.html and omits the chunkSizeWarning limit
